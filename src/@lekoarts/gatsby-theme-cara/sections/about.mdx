# About

City boy hailing from New York City, i'm in love with the city and can't see myself ever leaving. 
Been a computer enthusiast since i had my first PC when i was 5. Hobbies include coding, weightlifting, and gaming.
While in university i worked as a bartender where i learned to talk to people, learn their stories and the best part - make some amazing drinks!
After graduating from LIU i quickly realized i can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life, did a full 180 and finally pursued the career i was passionate about.

I chose this field for my love of computers and how every small component, snippet of code, etc is a small cog in the big wheel that controls everything!
I am very grateful for the skills and knowledge that I learned while pursuing Pharmacy. 
I aspire one day to move into machine learning and be apart of the future that the tech world is paving as we speak.
